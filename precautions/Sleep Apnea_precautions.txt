Precautions for Sleep Apnea Management:

Weight management: Obesity can worsen sleep apnea, so maintaining a healthy weight can improve breathing during sleep.
Lifestyle modifications: Avoid alcohol and sedatives before bed, which can relax the muscles in your throat and increase apnea severity. Limiting caffeine intake can also improve sleep quality.
Positional therapy: Sleep on your side rather than your back to keep your airway open. You can use pillows or a wedge to support yourself.
Nasal dilators or CPAP therapy: Nasal dilators can widen your nasal passages, while CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) therapy provides a constant flow of air to keep your airways open.
Dental appliances: Custom-made dental appliances can reposition your jaw and tongue to prevent airway obstruction.
