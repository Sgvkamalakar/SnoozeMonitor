To address your insomnia, it is crucial to implement certain precautions:

Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule: Go to bed and wake up around the same time each day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.
Create a Conducive Sleep Environment: Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Use blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine to minimize distractions.
Manage Stress: Identify sources of stress and develop coping mechanisms. Try relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.
Avoid Caffeine and Alcohol Before Bed: These substances can interfere with sleep quality. Limit caffeine intake several hours before bedtime and avoid alcohol close to bedtime.
Get Regular Exercise: Physical activity can improve sleep, but avoid exercising too close to bedtime, as it may make it harder to fall asleep.
